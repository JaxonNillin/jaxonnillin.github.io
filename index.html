        <h2>The Rise of a Failed Man. pt. 1</h2>
        <h4>The End of my Third Decade.</h4>
        <h6>Posted: 13 / February / 2026</h6>
        
        <p>Another year in the books with little to nothing to show for it, infact in some ways I have even less than I did a year ago. <em>(on a positive, that includes significantly less fat, having lost 30kg and having gained some muscle)</em><br> <br> The only things I can confidently say are stronger now are my beliefs and my resolve to chase a future worth living for. <br> <br> But by most of societies metrics I have nothing, No Wife, No Kids, No Job, No Car, No House.. I have a handfull of friends, and my health... <em>though both of those feel more fragile than I am comfortable with.</em> <br> <br> I <strong><em>DO</em></strong> have Goals though, not quite a stand in for the big dreams that seem to drive other people my age, like "starting a family" or "buying a house". But they're enough to give me direction for as long as I can keep choosing to forge ahead. <br> <br> Currently I'm working on getting a better body composition through regular weight-lifting and I'm also learning to Code. <br> <br> Here's hoping that leads to more options in the romance and employment areas of life. <br> <br> Also trying to get more practice driving so I can get a restricted license and eventually a car of my own, the increase in freedom and self-reliance that I imagine comes with reliable transport opens entire new worlds for me. <br> <br> Although the <em>WONDERS</em> that cycling all my life has done for my Hamstrings is much appreciated..</p>
        
        <h4>Goals Clarified</h4>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>A Body I'm Proud to Inhabit</li>
            <li>Finishing the beginner sections of Khan Academy's Computer Science / Programming Course</li>
            <li>A Restricted License</li>
            <li>A Job or a Larger Income</li>
            <li>Increase my Savings</li>
            
        </ul>

            <h2>The Rise of a Failed Man. pt. 2</h2>
            <h4>The Beginning of my Fourth Decade</h4>
            <h6>Posted: 14/ February / 2026</h6>
            
            <p> The Day started with some aches and pains and a lot of uncertainty. <br> <br>
                Will I be able to keep weight off if I keep losing weight or should I just give up and indulge my cravings for Cheese, Energy Drinks and Pies? <br>  <br>
                I know these questions and a handful of others will be on my mind for quite awhile, but for today I'm going to let myself go a bit. I have a lunch planned with 
                my Mother and Sister, so I'll enjoy it to it's fullest instead of curtailing my appetite. <br> <br>
                Hopefully next year I'll be dining with a woman who isn't family. <br> <br>
                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> <br>
                Lunch was good, we went to a crafts fair first and I was once again faced with all the projects I wish I would do but never get around to.
                A simultaneously inspiring and depressing experience. It was great seeing Mums partner doing well in thier booth though. <br>
                Some quality family time plus some Birthday money and I'm feeling good, though extremely full and in need of some exercise. <br> 
                So after some convincing from some online friends I'm off to the Gym to incorporate some of this Protein.<br><br>
